# Credit-Based Document Scanning System

## Overview
The Document Scanning and Matching System is a self-contained web application designed to allow users to efficiently scan, manage, and match documents. The system includes a built-in credit system that provides users with a daily limit of 20 free scans, with the option to request additional credits. This project aims to enhance document management through user-friendly features and AI-powered document matching capabilities.

## Bonus Features

- User activity logs to track scans and credit requests.
- Admin dashboard for approving credits and viewing analytics.
- Multi-user support to handle multiple users on the same local server.

### Credit System:
- Each user gets 20 free scans per day (auto-reset at midnight).
